# Types

The data that a computer uses for its computations is located in memory. Everything in the memory is really just numbers. We can, however, interpret these numbers in different ways. Depending on how you interpret it, the same data might represent a number, a snippet of text or even an image. The most common interpretations can be built into the language itself, as is the case with CoffeeScript. These interpretations are called *types*.

Let's try creating some different types of data. How about we start with some numbers? Open the CoffeeScript [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) with the `coffee` command and type in the following:

    4
    8
    15
    16
    23
    42

We're not just restricted to integers, we can of course represent any real number.ยน

    0.5
    123.45

As you see, after each input the REPL responds by echoing the same number that was entered. Each row you entered is actually a *statement*, a piece of code that the computer executes. The echoed number is actually the result of evaluating the code you just typed. But more on that later, let's create a bit of text, or a *string* as the technical term is.

    "We can write text within double ticks..."
    '... or single ticks'

Another type that is very common in programming, but that doesn't have much recognition anywhere else is the *boolean*. Booleans have only two possible values, either `true` or `false`.

    true
    false

These values will come in handy later on when we need our code to react to different circumstances.

That's it for data types; next up is operations!
