# Loops

Now we've learnt how to store the results of computations in variables and even how to bundle a series of computations together with functions. That's quite nifty and allows us to compute things a lot faster than if we were to do it by hand. But what happens when you have to perform the same operation 10 times? Well, we could just write out the same function call 10 times over. But what if we needed to perform that same operation 100 times, or how about 1000000 times? Obviously, this is not something we programmers relish doing.

Luckily, we have before us a device that does whatever we tell it to do, and a lot quicker than we could ourselves. That's where *loops* come in.

## Exercises

1. Make the computer print out your own name 100 times.
2. Create a function which prints out each element of the list, but in reverse order.
3. Create a function which finds the largest number in a list of numbers.
4. Go to `apps/monty-hall` and follow the instructions in the `README` file.
